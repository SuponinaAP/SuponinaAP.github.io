This week I managed to do several different works on the discipline ‘Modelling of wireless networks’, on the discipline ‘Construction and analysis of models of wireless networks 5G/6G’ and two on ‘Scientific Programming’.

For the first two papers I wrote code in the Python programming language. For the first two papers, I studied different models to investigate network blocking and learnt how to create a program that calculates whether there is blocking or not for randomly generated blockers.

On ‘Scientific Programming’ in a group project, I worked with my team to find different algorithms and summarise the work we had done. We combined all of our research into a final presentation and evaluated the impact of disease and recovery rates on epidemic development.

I also did individual lab work 5, for this I created two folders for each language, in which I put all the information and posts in both languages.
