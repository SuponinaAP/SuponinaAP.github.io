## STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS

The structural elements of the explanatory note (EL) are:

- title page;
- abstract;
- content;
- introduction;
- main part;
- conclusion;
- list of used sources;
- appendices.

Each structural element should start from a new sheet!


## GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

1) Font: Times New Roman, plain, colour: black, size 14 p,
2) Text alignment - width,
3) Line spacing - one and a half,
4) Red line (paragraph indent) - 1.25 cm,
5) Indentation and spacing in the text - 0 cm.


## CONTENTS

Paragraphs **COUNTER, INTRODUCTION, CONCLUSION, LIST OF SOURCES, APPENDICES** (or APPENDIX A,
APPENDIX B, etc.) are NOT numbered and should be written in capital letters.

The title of **subsections** (second level headings) are moved by 2 characters (0.5 cm - on the ruler) and **sequential paragraph titles** by another 2 characters, i.e. a total of 4 characters (1 cm - on the ruler). If the title is long, it should be continued on the next line with the same indentation as on the first line.

Each entry of the content is formed as a separate paragraph, aligned to the left.

Page numbers are indicated aligned to the right margin and connected with the name of the structural element or section of the report by means of an indent.


## DOCUMENT SECTIONS

**Section headings** are written with a paragraph indent (like the main text), dots are NOT placed at the end of figures and heading text. To emphasise headings, use
bold, uppercase and lowercase, with one blank line after the heading and subheading.

Titles of sections **CONCLUSION, INTRODUCTION, CONCLUSION, LIST
**MEMBERS ONLY**SIGN UP NOW*** always start on a new page, written in capital letters in the middle of the line, where:
- Line spacing: - one and a half line spacing
- Red line: - none
- Paragraph indents and spacing: in the text - 0 cm.


## ENUMERATIONS (LISTS)

Each position of an enumeration should be preceded by a dash or, if it is necessary to refer in the text of the document to one of the enumerations, by a lowercase letter starting with the letter ‘a’ (except for - d, e, z, y, o, ъ, s, y), followed by a parenthesis.

**NOT** the use of the given dot ‘ ’ is allowed.

When there is a specific number of enumerations, it is acceptable to use Arabic numerals with brackets.

To further elaborate on the enumerations, Arabic numerals followed by a parenthesis should be used, and the entry should be indented as in normal text.
regular text.


## FIGURES

BEFORE inserting a figure, there must be a reference to it in the text, **a full caption** under the figure, and a blank line after the figure.

Abbreviations like Fig.5 are not allowed! In the text it is obligatory to write in full - Figure 5. If there is only one figure in the report, it should be labelled ‘Figure 1’. 


## FORMULAS AND EQUATIONS

Equations and formulae should be separated from the text on a separate line. At least one free line should be left above and below each formula or equation.

If an equation does not fit on one line, it should be moved after the equal sign (=) or after the plus (+), minus (-), multiplication (x), division (:), or other mathematical signs, with the equation sign following the equals sign (=) or after the plus (+), minus (-), multiplication (x), division (:), or other
mathematical signs, with the sign at the beginning of the next line repeated. When transposing a formula on a sign symbolising a multiplication operation, the ‘X’ sign is used.

References in the text to ordinal numbers of formulas are indicated in brackets, for example, ‘.... in formula (1)’.

For paragraphs of text containing formulae, it is recommended to set the same parameters as for the main text.

Explanations of symbols and numerical coefficients included in the formula, if they are not explained earlier in the text, should be given directly below the formula.

Explanations of each symbol should be given on a new line in the sequence in which the symbols are given in the formula. The first line of the explanation should begin with
the word ‘where’ without a colon after it.


## TABLES

Tables are numbered in Arabic numerals by consecutive numbering; the title of the table should be placed above the table on the left without a paragraph indent in one line with its number through a dash, for example, ‘Table 1 - Title’ (no dot at the end);

As with the figure, before inserting the table, you should provide a reference to what is placed in it. For example: ‘Prices for some software are presented in
Table 1.’

Tables on the left, right and bottom are limited by lines. 

It is allowed to use a smaller font size in the table than in the text.

In appendices, tables are labelled: Table A.1 - Initial data.

If the table takes more than two pages, then after the first transfer of the table write ‘Continuation of Table 1’, and on the most
on the very last page ‘End of Table 1’.

It is not allowed to include the column ‘Number in order’ in the table. If it is necessary to number indicators, parameters or other data, the serial numbers should be indicated in the first column (sidebar) of the table immediately before their name.


## APPENDICES

Appendices may include some figures and fragments of source code, acts of implementation of the results of the work, etc. The appendices should be numbered by numbers. 

Appendices are NOT numbered by numbers, but are labelled in RUSSIAN letters. If there is only one appendix, it is labelled ‘APPENDIX A’.

Each appendix starts on a new page.

All appendices, as well as figures, should be referenced in the text of the report, for example: ‘A snippet of the main page code is presented in Appendix A’.

The captions to the figures will be appropriate: Figure A -...., - if there is only one figure in the appendix. Or: Figure A.1 - ... etc., if there are several figures in one annex.

## LIST OF SOURCES USED
It is necessary that each item in the list of used sources must be referenced in the text (in square brackets with the source number).

Sources in the list should be arranged in the order of appearance of references to the sources in the text of the explanatory note and numbered with Arabic numerals without a dot and printed with a paragraph indent, as well as the usual text.

**For example, in the text:**

The first game was Tetris, which appeared on a Danish-made phone.
Hagenuk MT-2000.
And in the list of used sources under number 2 should be the name of the book or electronic resource from which this phrase is taken. One source can be referred to
to one source several times, but it is not necessary to do it in every sentence.
