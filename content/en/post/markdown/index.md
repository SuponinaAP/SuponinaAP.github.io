### History of Creation

### Quote from Wiki:

Originally created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz. Many of the language's ideas were borrowed from existing conventions for marking up text in emails. Markdown language implementations convert Markdown-formatted text into valid, properly constructed XHTML and replace left angle brackets (‘<’) and ampersands (‘&’) with appropriate entity codes. The first implementation of Markdown was a Perl implementation written by Gruber, but many third-party implementations have appeared over time (see below). The Perl implementation is distributed under a BSD licence. Markdown implementations in various programming languages are included (or available as a plugin) in many content management systems.

## Syntax examples

‘#’ - converts text to a header, the higher the # the lower the level of the header

[Headers](IndLab3.jpg)

- ‘* ... '* - italicises text, analogue of italics in docs

- ** ... ** ... ** - text highlighting, analogue to bold in docs

- *** ... *** ... *** - bold italics in docs

- ~~ ... ~~~ - crossed out text

- ` ... ` - for writing code
