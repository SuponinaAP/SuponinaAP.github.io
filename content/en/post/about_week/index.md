This week I had time to do a few different papers. 

- For ‘Modelling Wireless Networks’ I did lab three, in which I wrote a program that distributed randomly generated points in a circle inscribed in a square and a circle defined in a polar coordinate system. I calculated the density of distribution for the resulting points, as well as the mathematical expectation and variance.

- On ‘Scientific programming’ I worked together with partners on realisation of the problem about epidemic with the help of programming language Julia. I got acquainted with the library DifferentialEquations, which uses the Runge-Kutta method of the 5th order to work with differential equations. We also wrote a working programme first for two different cases when the number of infected people is less and more than a critical value, and then combined these cases and wrote a general solution for the problem.

- Also in ‘Scientific Programming’, I did the fourth stage of the individual project. While doing this, I registered on many websites with scientific publications and articles, as well as created a new post on the website dedicated to - Report Design.
