This week I had time to do several different works, two of which were on ‘Modelling of wireless networks’ and two on ‘Scientific programming’.

For the first two papers I wrote code in the Python programming language. I learnt how to calculate mathematical expectation and variance and worked with two libraries numpy and matplotlib.pyplot. I created sets of points with different distributions such as normal, exponential or Laplace. I drew graphs on which these points were displayed and watched how the number of points affects the accuracy of the graph compared to the graph created by theoretical formulas taken from wikipedia.

On ‘Scientific Programming’ in group project, I together with my team found different algorithms to solve the problem about the epidemic, we approached algorithms from three sides and made one simple and analytical, also got acquainted with Runge-Kutta algorithm. We also learnt about the existence of DifferentialEquations library for solving differential equations in Julia programming language, got acquainted with how it works and figured out which of its functions we will need for numerical solution of our problem.

I also did individual lab work 3, in which I contributed information about my research achievements, experience and work to the website. I also published a post related to Markdown markup language.
